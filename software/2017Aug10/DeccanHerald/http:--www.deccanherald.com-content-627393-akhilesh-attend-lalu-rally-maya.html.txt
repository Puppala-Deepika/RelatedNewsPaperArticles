Hoping to form a 'mahagathbandhan' (grand alliance) to counter the BJP in the next Lok Sabha polls in 2019, Samajwadi Party (SP) supremo Akhilesh Yadav would be attending Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad Yadav's proposed rally in Patna on August 27.
BSP supremo Mayawati, however, has not yet decided on attending the RJD rally.
Akhilesh, while speaking to reporters here on Thursday said that he would take part in the rally at Patna as he wanted the opposition parties to form a 'mahagathbandhan' to ''thwart'' the BJP's attempt to return to power in 2019.
It was however not clear if the SP patron Mulayam Singh Yadav with whom Akhilesh had been having a running feud would also be participating the rally.
Akhilesh remained tightlipped when asked if the opposition would take on the BJP unitedly in the forthcoming by-polls to two Lok Sabha seats in UP to be vacated by chief minister Yogi Adityanath and deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya. ''No decision has yet be taken in this regard...you (media) will have to wait,'' he quipped.
The SP supremo claimed that both Adityanath and Maurya did not want to contest the assembly by-polls as they felt that they might lose. ''Both of them are afraid of facing the people and hence the saffron party has been luring our MLCs so that these two and others may get elected to the legislative council,'' he said.
BSP supremo Mayawati, according to the sources, has not yet taken any decision on attending the RJD rally. Lalu Yadav had offered to send her to Rajya Sabha on his party's ticket from Bihar.
''A decision will be taken in this regard in the next few days,'' said a senior state BSP leader while speaking to Deccan Herald here.
