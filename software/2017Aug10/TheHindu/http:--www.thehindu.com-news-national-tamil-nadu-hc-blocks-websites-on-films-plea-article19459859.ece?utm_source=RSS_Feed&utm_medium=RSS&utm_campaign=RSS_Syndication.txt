The Madras High Court recently granted interim injunctions to two identical petitions filed by the producers of two Hindi films by ordering the blocking of a total of 2,650 websites and web pages.
The producers of Lipstick Under My Burkha and Jab Harry Met Sejal — Prakash Jha Productions and Red Chillies Entertainment Pvt. Ltd. — approached the court of Justice Anita Sumanth.
While Lipstick was granted interim injunction on July 21, Jab Harry was granted the same on August 2.
While Prakash Jha Productions was granted injunction for a week on July 21, Red Chillies was granted injunction till August 7.
The interim injunctions have led to the widespread blocking of the non-profit archive.org, known as the Way Back Machine.
The website lets users archive and access data for free. As of Wednesday night, archive.org hosted 302 billion web pages and 14 million texts, among others.
The petitions wanted compliance from 37 Internet service providers, five Chennai-based cable companies and eight individuals — all unknown and named Ashok Kumar.
Both production houses submitted identical lists of 2,650 websites and web pages along with their petitions.
