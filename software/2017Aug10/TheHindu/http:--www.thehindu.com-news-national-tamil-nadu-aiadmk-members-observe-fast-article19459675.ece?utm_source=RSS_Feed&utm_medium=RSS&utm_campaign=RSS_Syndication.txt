Demand merger of two factions and retention of the ‘two leaves’ symbol
Two AIADMK members observed a day-long fast on Wednesday demanding the merger of the three factions of the party.
N. P. Gangadharan, who joined the party a year-and-a-half ago, and Salavai Sampath of Gudiyatham observed the fast near the MGR statue at Gudiyatham. “The party is now divided into three factions led by O. Panneerselvam, chief minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami and T.T.V. Dhinakaran. The three factions should merge for protecting the cadre,” Mr. Gangadharan said. He said the “Two Leaves” symbol can be regained only if the three factions merged. “Only then will Amma’s dream come true,” he said. The duo observed a fast from 8 a.m. to 5.30 p.m.
