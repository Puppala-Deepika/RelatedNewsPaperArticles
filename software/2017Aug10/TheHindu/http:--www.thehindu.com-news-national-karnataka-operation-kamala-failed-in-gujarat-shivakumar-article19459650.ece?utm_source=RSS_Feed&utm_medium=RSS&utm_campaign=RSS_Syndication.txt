Enthused by the victory of the Congress veteran Ahmed Patel in the Rajya Sabha election, Energy Minister D.K. Shivakumar, who played a pivotal role in “protecting” Gujarat Congress legislators from being “poached” by the BJP, on Wednesday said that ‘Operation Kamala’ had failed in that State.
Mr. Shivakumar’s role has been acknowledged by the party’s central leadership, according to sources.
D.K. Suresh, Bengaluru Rural MP, said Mr. Patel had also thanked his brother, Mr. Shivakumar.
“Mr. Patel and other top leaders from our party called my brother soon after the results were announced to thank him,” he said.
At the KPCC function to mark the 75th anniversary of the Quit India Movement, Mr. Shivakumar applauded the Election Commission of India for “making people to repose their faith in democracy”.
