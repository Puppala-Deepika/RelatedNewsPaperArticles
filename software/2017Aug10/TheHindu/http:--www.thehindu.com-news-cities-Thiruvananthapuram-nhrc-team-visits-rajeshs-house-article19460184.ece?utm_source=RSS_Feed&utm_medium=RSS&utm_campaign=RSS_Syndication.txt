Family says they are unsatisfied with Kerala police probe, wants another agency to investigate it.
A delegation of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) on Wednesday visited the house of RSS functionary Rajesh who was murdered last month. The team, which included Deputy Superintendents of Police (Dy.SPs) I.R. Kurillose and Ravi Singh, and Inspectors Bimaljit Uppal and Rajendra Singh, spoke to his family members for close to an hour.
According to Rajesh’s brother Rajeev, the family conveyed the fact that they were unsatisfied with the ongoing investigation of the Kerala Police. They have asked for the investigation to be handed over to another agency.
“We told the delegation that the police have not yet started looking into the conspiracy behind the murder. There was a clear conspiracy in the murder, as I got death threats from a person a few days before the murder. To add to that, the twelfth accused was given bail last week. All this shows that the investigation is not progressing in the right direction. A case was registered under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, only after the intervention of the SC commission,” he said.
The family also told that delegation that three more persons, whom they suspect to have been involved in the murder, are yet to be arrested, despite them handing over the names last week.
Media persons were not allowed in the house when the delegation met the family. Later, BJP district president S.Suresh explained the happenings to the media, outside the house.
