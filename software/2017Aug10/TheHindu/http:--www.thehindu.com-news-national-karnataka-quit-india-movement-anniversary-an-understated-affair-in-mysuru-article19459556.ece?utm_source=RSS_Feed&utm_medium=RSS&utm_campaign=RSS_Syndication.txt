Independence Day
The 75th anniversary of Quit India Movement of 1942 on Wednesday was a low-key affair in Mysuru.
A flag hoisting ceremony was observed by members of the Mysuru District Freedom Fighters’ Association. D.S. Jagadish, a member of the association, said about 15 to 20 members took part in the function and some of them recalled events associated with the movement.
“Most of us are in the evening of our lives and cannot take part in elaborate functions or in processions unlike in the past,” Mr. Jagadish said. Most members say that they loathe the current state of affairs and lament how it is in contrast to the dreams and visions of a generation that braved police lathis and bullets to fight for freedom.
“There was a unanimity of thought and vision that we held sacred. There were no party politics in what was done,” said Mr. Jagadish. Money power which drives today’s politics simply did not exist, he added. Other members included M.G. Krishnamurthy and Revanna.
The Quit India Movement marked the belated entry of the region into the mainstream freedom struggle. For, historians aver that the princely Mysore was well-cushioned by the ‘benevolent’ rule of the later Wadiyars and hence did not feel the pinch of British imperialism.
However, decades of social work and reforms, besides increasing political awareness, helped galvanise public opinion in favour of Independence from the British. It was the student community and the youth of the region who plunged themselves into the movement, courted arrest, planned picketing, civil disobedience, among other struggles. The Subbarayanakere ground was the site of public rallies.
The traction gained by the Quit India Movement provided enough momentum for the culmination of Mysore Chalo that saw the stepping down of the Maharaja and the swearing-in of a representative government five years later.
