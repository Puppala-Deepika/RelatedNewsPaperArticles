Tribal people, who came from various places in the State as also those from Visakhapatnam Agency areas, were amused to see Governor E.S.L. Narasimhan and Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu trying their headgear, holding their children and interacting with dance troupes at the Adivasi Day celebrations at the NTR Grounds here on Wednesday. On arrival, the two were welcomed with traditional Dhimsa and Kommu dances. They shook a leg with the dancers and posed for pictures. They went around the stalls and interacted with local people.
The Governor and the Chief Minister sipped Araku coffee at a stall. Mr. Naidu tasted Araku pepper. Mr. Narasimhan mounted a tractor put on display at the exhibition.
Tribal artistes, who came from different parts of the State and boys and girls of tribal welfare schools presented traditional and modern dances. Nature Cultural Force of Araku presented an educative and entertaining ‘dappu’ programme.
Students, dressed in colourful attire, enthralled the gathering. The dance to the popular Odiya song ‘Rango bothi, rango bothi...’ was a highlight.
