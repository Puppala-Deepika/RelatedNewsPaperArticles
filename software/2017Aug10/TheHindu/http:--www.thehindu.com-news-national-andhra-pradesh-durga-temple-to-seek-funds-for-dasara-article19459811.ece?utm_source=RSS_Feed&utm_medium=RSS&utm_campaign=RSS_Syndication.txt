₹4 crore needed to organise the nine-day festival
The trust board of Sri Durga Malleswara Swamy Varla Devasthanam at its first meeting on Wednesday decided to write to the State government seeking funds to conduct the Dasara festival which was declared a State festival three years ago.
Addressing a press conference later, temple Executive Officer A. Suryakumari said the government had not allocated any funds for the nine-day festival after declaring it a State festival. The board appealed to the government to sanction ₹10 crore.
At the meeting held at the Madapati Guest House, the EO and the board members discussed many issues. One of the key topics was preparations for the festival.
Board chairman Gouranga Babu said, “We have discussed arrangements needed for the Dasara festival. As per our estimation, ₹3 crore to ₹4 crore is needed to organise the festival.” Ms. Suryakumari said 70,000 devotees per day were expected during the nine days. The focus would be on improving the quality of prasadam and other facilities. She said an information centre would be set up in the premises of the Pandit Nehru Bus Station (PNBS).
Mobile app launched
The board also launched an android smartphone application for the temple. Devotees can book various services of the temple through the app which also provides all information relating to it. The app was developed by Visakhapatnam-based YTR Technologies.
