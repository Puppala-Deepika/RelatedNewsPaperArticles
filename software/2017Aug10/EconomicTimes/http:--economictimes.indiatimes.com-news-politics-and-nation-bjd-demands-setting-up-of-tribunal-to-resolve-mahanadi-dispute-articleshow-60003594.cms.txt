NEW DELHI: BJD members in Lok Sabha today demanded the immediate setting up of a tribunal to resolve the Mahanadi water dispute with neighbouring Chhattisgarh .
Raising the issue during Zero Hour, Bhartruhari Mahtab said the tribunal to resolve the disputes was yet to be formed even though the Supreme Court had favoured it.
Terming the issue as "very serious", agitated BJD MPs came into the aisles but did not enter the well demanding a response from the government on setting up of the tribunal.
Mahtab also asked the Centre to direct the Chhattisgarh government to stop construction of projects on the upstream of Mahanadi , saying these were seriously affecting flow of the river .
Chhattisgarh government has already rejected Odisha government's demand to stop construction work.
"The Centre must set up the tribunal immediately," said Mahtab.
