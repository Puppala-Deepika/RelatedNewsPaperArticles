Bajpai protests ‘sidelining’ of Mulayam
On a day when Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav started a political campaign against the BJP with a rally in symbolically important Faizabad, he suffered a fresh setback as another senior MLC quit the SP on Wednesday.
Ashok Bajpai resigned from his post, expressing disappointment with the current leadership under Mr. Akhilesh for ‘sidelining’ Mulayam Singh, the SP founder, while ‘giving prominence’ to those who bore “no connection to the Samajwadi movement or ideology.”
“Mulayam Singh Yadavji is sidelined in the party he built, facing neglect and insult,” Mr. Bajpai said.
Fourth to quit
Incidentally, Mr. Bajpai’s tenure was to end in 2021. He became the fourth SP MLC to resign from his post in the past two weeks, following in the steps of Bukkal Nawab, Yashwant Singh and Sarojini Agarwal.
Mr. Nawab, Mr. Singh and Mr. Agarwal later joined the BJP, and speculation is rife that Mr. Bajpai may follow suit. Former BSP MLC Thakur Jaiveer Singh, who quit his party along with Mr. Nawab and Mr. Singh, also joined the BJP.
The rumour mills got activated further as senior BSP leader Ambika Chaudhary also reached the Vidhan Parishad to offer his resignation. Though he resigned from his MLC post, Mr. Chaudhary said he was only resigning for technical reasons and was working with the BSP with ‘honour’ and had ‘no complaints’.
