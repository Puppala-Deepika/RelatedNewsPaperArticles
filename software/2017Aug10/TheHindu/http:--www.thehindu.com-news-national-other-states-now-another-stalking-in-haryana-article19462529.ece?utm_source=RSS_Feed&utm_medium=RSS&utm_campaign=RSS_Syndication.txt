A 25-year-old woman riding two-wheeler in Gurugram chased by two men in white sedan, unable to reach police control room or helpline.
Close on the heels of a stalking case involving Haryana BJP chief Subhash Barala's son Vikas and his friend Ashish, a woman returning from work was chased by two unidentified men in a car for more than two km on Old Delhi-Gurugram Road here late on Monday night.
A case has been registered in this connection at Sector 14 Police Station.
The 25-year-old woman, who works in a private firm in Udyog Vihar, was on her home from office on two-wheeler around midnight on Monday night when two men in a car started following her. The duo allegedly tried to block her vehicle. Then they chased her for around 2 km from Udgoy Vihar to Atul Kataria Chowk and then gave up.
However, the complainant had to run from pillar to post to get her complaint registered as the Sector 14 police initially refused to file the FIR saying that the matter pertained to Sector 18 Police Station. The FIR was registered after the intervention of the Police Commissioner, Sandeep Khirwar.
Sector 14 Police Inspector Bhartendra Kumar said the closed circuit television footage of the incident was not available. They got little help from the complainant, Mr. Kumar said.  “Despite repeated attempts the complainant could not be contacted for more information on the case. Based on her information in the FIR, the two vehicles we have zeroed in on are a mini-bus and a motorcycle.”
He also denied allegations of refusal of FIR saying that the victim was only advised to approach the police station concerned.
