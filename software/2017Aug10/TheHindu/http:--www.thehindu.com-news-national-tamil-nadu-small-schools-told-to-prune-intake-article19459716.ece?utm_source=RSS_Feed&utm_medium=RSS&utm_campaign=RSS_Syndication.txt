Education department issues directives on infrastructure
Through a set of directives issued by the Director of Matriculation schools on Wednesday, private schools which are functioning without the minimum required space have been instructed to decrease their student intake over the next four years so that they can meet the current norms.
According to the directives issued, a classroom should have 10 sq feet of space per student and 40 sq feet space for the teacher. Matriculation inspectors have also been asked to keep checking whether these norms are being followed.
“In a phased manner, the number of students should be brought down to adhere to the current norms. In the next few years, the schools which do not have enough space should not start any additional sections or classes as well without the available infrastructure,” it stated. The schools have also been instructed to procure and submit the building permit, stability certificate and a fire safety certificate; they have also been asked to get the campus inspected by a health inspector when they apply for recognition. A written undertaking will also be procured from the correspondents of schools so that they do not shift students between branches of their institutions without their consent.
In 2016, the High Court had directed the State government to include educational experts in a committee constituted to finalise norms relating to the minimum land requirement for over 746 unrecognised schools in the State.
