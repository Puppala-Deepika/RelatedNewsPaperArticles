AIADMK dumps Dhinakaran as Deputy General Secretary
CHENNAI: The AIADMK faction led by Tamil Nadu Chief Minister E.K. Palaniswami on Wednesday declared as null and void the appointment of T.T.V. Dhinakaran as the Deputy General Secretary.
A resolution to this effect was moved at a meeting chaired by Palaniswami at the AIADMK headquarters here.
"Dhinakaran's appointment as Deputy General Secretary is illegal as per the party rules. He cannot hold any party post since he was not a party member for a continuous five years," said the resolution.
It added that a case was also pending with the Election Commission regarding his appointment.
The AIADMK also said that Dhinakaran was creating confusion by appointing several party office bearers. "Therefore, Dhinakaran's announcements also invalid."
