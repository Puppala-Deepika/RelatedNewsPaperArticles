Deputy Commissioner Rohini Sindhuri has instructed doctors and other staff of the Health and Family Welfare Department to take necessary measures to avoid infanticide in the district.
At a meeting with officials on Wednesday, the officer said the department should ensure that not even one instance of infanticide is reported in the district. “Similarly, the maternal mortality rate should be brought to zero. No woman should die at the time of giving birth. Doctors and the supporting staff need to ensure this,” she said.
In order to improve health services in the district, the officer said a vigilance team would make surprise visits to hospitals to take note of negligence if any. “The erring staff will face strict action. The District Health Officer and his staff have to ensure effective delivery of services,” she said.
DHO R. Venkatesh, Hassan Institute of Medical Sciences director B.C. Ravi Kumar and others were present.
