Senior Congress leaders in the State have lauded Congress veteran Ahmed Patel’s election to the Rajya Sabha from Gujarat.
Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said here on Wednesday that Mr. Patel’s election was a major setback to the money power politics and communal fascist positions of the Bharatiya Janata Party.
Addressing a party function here, he said Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah were undermining secularism and democracy through the misuse of power and money and promoting horse trading.
The Sangh Parivar’s agenda was to latch on to power by triggering communal polarisation, he said.
KPCC president M.M. Hassan said Mr. Patel’s victory was a fitting reply to Mr. Shah, who had no qualms in capturing power by promoting horse trading and sowing seeds of communalism.
Former KPCC president V. M. Sudheeran said the victory would be a boost to secular and democratic forces in the country.
The elections had reduced Mr. Modi and Mr. Shah to the status of mere conspirators and deceitful persons as a result of their manipulation in the election for Gujarat.
