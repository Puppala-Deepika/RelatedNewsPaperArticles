Validity to be 2 days for 100 km and 3 days up to 500 km
The State Government has notified rules for issuance and validity of the waybill that will be issued for carrying consignment of goods within and outside the State.
The rules have been issued in the absence of ‘e-waybill system’ proposed to be put in place by the Goods and Services Tax Council to ensure that there are no instances of misuse of the waybills.
Accordingly, waybill issued for movement of goods for destinations less than 100 km would be valid for two days from the day and time it is generated. The validity would be for three days if the distance between the origin and destination of the consignment is 101 km to 500 km.
Waybills issued for consignments that would cover distances between 1,001 km and 2,000 km would be for 10 days and it would be 12 days for those covering more than 2,000 km. The notification would, however, be not applicable for movement of alcoholic liquor for consumption, petroleum crude, high speed diesel oil, motor spirit, natural gas and aviation turbine fuel as they would follow the procedures under the value added tax act, 2005 for waybills.
Meanwhile, Chief Secretary S.P. Singh convened a meeting of the secretaries of different departments to discuss about the possible impact of the GST regime on their functioning.
The Chief Secretary directed the officials concerned to prepare reports on the burden incurred by their respective departments due to the implementation of the new tax regime.
They should take steps to educate the implementing agencies on the GST system to ensure that the pace of work in projects like Mission Bhagiratha, Mission Kakatiya and two bedroom housing scheme was not impacted by the new tax regime.
