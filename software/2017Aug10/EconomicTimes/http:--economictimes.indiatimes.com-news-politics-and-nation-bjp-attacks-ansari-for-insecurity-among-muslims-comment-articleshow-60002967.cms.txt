NEW DELHI: The BJP today criticised outgoing Vice President Hamid Ansari for his comment that there was a sense of insecurity among Muslims and said such a "petty" remark was not expected from someone in his position.
BJP general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya also wondered if Ansari was looking for "political shelter" after retirement.
"I condemn his comments. He has made political comments as he is retiring. He is still a vice president and such comments do not suit his office's dignity. It seems he is making such comments to find political shelter after retirement," Vijayvargiya said.
Nobody expects such "petty comments" from a person holding such a high post, he added.
Ansari, whose second five-year term as the vice president ends today, has said in an interview that there is a feeling of unease and a sense of insecurity among Muslims in the country, claiming that the "ambience of acceptance" is now under threat.
Ansari's remarks come against the backdrop of incidents of alleged intolerance and violence by self-proclaimed cow protectors, for which opposition parties have attacked the central government.
