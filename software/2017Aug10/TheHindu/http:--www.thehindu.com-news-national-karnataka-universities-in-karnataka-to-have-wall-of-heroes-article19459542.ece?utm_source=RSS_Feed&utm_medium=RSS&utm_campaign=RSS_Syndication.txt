Portraits of 21 Param Vir Chakra recipients to be displayed
Universities across the State will now have a wall of heroes with portraits of 21 Param Vir Chakra recipients.
The Vidya Veertha Abhiyan, which aims to create a spirit of respect for soldiers and inculcate values such as patriotism among the youth, was launched by Governor and Chancellor of Universities Vajubhai R. Vala on Wednesday. Urging the vice-chancellors of universities to encourage students to work for the betterment of the nation, Mr. Vala said, “A student who gets 40 marks and works for the nation is better than a student who gets 95 marks and does nothing for the nation.”
Vice-chancellors and Registrars of several universities attended the event where Mr. Vala handed them CDs containing 21 pictures of the Param Vir Chakra recipients.
Param Vir Chakra recipient Yogendra Singh Yadav was also present at the event and recollected some of the challenging times during the Kargil war. The former MP Tarun Vijay, president of the abhiyan, said they plan to take the initiative to colleges and universities across the country.
