“We launched operations from Chinavutapalli village recently, and our priority is to provide security to Velagapudi. The forces will also take up anti-Maoist activities on AOB and in Kothagudem-Bhadradri district in Telangana”, Mr. Kumar told The Hindu.
Due to security reasons, the battalion headquarters was set up away from Naxal dominated villages and near the Capital region.
