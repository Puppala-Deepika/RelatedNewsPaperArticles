Death due to denial of treatment
The government on Thursday tendered an apology to the family of a migrant worker from Tamil Nadu who succumbed to injures sustained in a road accident after allegedly being denied treatment by various hospitals in the State.
Terming the incident as a blot on Kerala, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan apologised to the bereaved family and assured the Assembly that the government would consider a new legislation or appropriate amendments to existing laws to prevent the recurrence of such shameful episodes.
Intervening after the Health Minister’s reply to the notice for an adjournment motion moved by Congress leader Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishnan, he said, “I, on behalf of the State government, apologise to the family of Murugan and share their grief.” He also assured the House that an expert medical team would be constituted to investigate the incident and recommend steps to prevent its recurrence.
Describing the incident as unfortunate, Health Minister K.K. Shylaja said Murugan had succumbed to his injuries after he was denied primary treatment by five private hospitals. “The accident victim, who was in a critical state, had to be turned away from the Government Medical College Hospital, Thiruvananthapuram, because none of the ventilators for advanced critical care were available”
The Minister said the police had registered a case and launched an investigation. A departmental inquiry had also been ordered into the incident, she informed the House.
