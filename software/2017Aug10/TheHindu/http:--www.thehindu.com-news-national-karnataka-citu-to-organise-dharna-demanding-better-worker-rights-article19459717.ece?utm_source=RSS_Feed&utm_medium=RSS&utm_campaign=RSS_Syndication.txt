The Hassan district committee of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) has decided to stage a dharna on the eve of Independence Day pressing for a decent living for all workers.
The dharna has been named ‘Dudiyuva Janara Swathantrakkagi Satyagraha’ (Seeking freedom for the working class). Members of CITU will hold the dharna from 6 p.m. on August 14 to 6 a.m. the next day.
Dharmesh, district president, CITU, at a press conference on Wednesday, said even 70 years after India got Independence, the working class were denied equal rights on a par with the rich. “Millions of workers are toiling to earn a meagre salary. They have not been given job security and minimum wages have also been denied. Considering this, the workers have not yet got freedom in a true sense. We are organising the dharna to highlight the conditions of the working class and demand benefits for them,” he said.
The workers will hold the dharna in all taluk centres in the district. Members of like-minded organisations have been invited to take part.
CITU general secretary D.L. Raghavendra, secretary K.S. Manjunath and treasurer M.B. Pushpa were present.
