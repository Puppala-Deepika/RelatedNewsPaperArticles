Malayalam actor Dileep, arrested in connection with alleged conspiracy behind the molestation of an actress, on Thursday moved the Kerala High Court seeking bail, for the second time.
In his bail application, Dileep contended that he was the victim of a conspiracy hatched by a powerful lobby working against him in the Malayalam film industry. He maintained that he had never met or spoken with the prime accused in the case, Sunilkumar aka ‘Pulsar’ Suni. The prosecution case is that Suni was “hired” by Dileep for the sexual assault as part of a conspiracy against the actress whom Dileep had personal differences with. The actress was abducted and molested in a moving car in Kochi, in the night of February 17, by Suni.
The actor was arrested on July 10. On July 24, a single bench of the High Court had denied him bail, stating that evidence presented by the prosecution prima facie established that there were materials to suspect his involvement in the crime. The court had also observed that there was a possibility of the accused influencing the witnesses while he was out on bail.
In the fresh bail plea Dileep, the 11th accused in the case, pointed out that the investigation agency didn’t have a case to show that he “threatened or influenced or in any manner contacted” the witnesses. The petitioner also said his continued detention would have a “catastrophic” effect on the lives of people connected with movies he has committed to act in. The budget of these films, together, is above Rs 50 crore.
Dileep is lodged in the Aluva sub-jail. The Judicial First Class Magistrate court in Angamaly had on Tuesday extended the actor’s custody till August 22.
