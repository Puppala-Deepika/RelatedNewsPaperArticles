A Class XII student was brutally stabbed to death in full public view by a youth, who had been stalking her for several months, and his friends in Uttar Pradesh’s Ballia district, about 400 km from here.
According to police, the 17-year-old girl was stabbed to death while she was on her way to school near Bajahan village in the district on Tuesday.
Five youths, including the main accused, who is the son of Bajahan panchayat chief, were booked in the matter, the police said, adding that two of them were arrested on Wednesday.
The younger sister of the victim, who was accompanying her, said that Prince Tiwari, the village pradhan’s son, who was riding a motorbike, hit their cycle from behind as a result of which they fell on the ground. “Prince stabbed didi (sister) several times on her neck and chest, when she protested,” she said.
Eyewitnesses said there were four other youths with Prince, who, too, were carrying sharp weapons. No one came to the victim’s rescue.
The victim’s mother said Prince had been stalking her daughter for the past several months. “He would often stalk her, pass lewd comments at her while she was on her way to school,” she said.
The victim’s father had also approached the Bansdih Road police station and lodged a complaint against Prince, but the police reportedly brokered a compromise rather than taking action against him. The police said two of the accused, including Prince, have been arrested and a massive hunt is on to nab the others.
