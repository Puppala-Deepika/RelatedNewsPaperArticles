Stickers of movie can be shared in conversations
The producers of the upcoming film Velaiilla Pattadhari 2, popularly called VIP 2, have inked a pact with Hike Messenger as part of their branding campaign. Hike has created a unique collection of animated and static stickers that reflect the story and characters of the film featuring Dhanush and Kajol.
“Market dynamics have changed. Today, we cater to a global audience and work on promotions accordingly. Through Hike, one can bring conversations alive with animated stickers of Dhanush as he plays the angry young man or Kajol as she tosses her head in style,” D. Paranthaman, chief executive officer of V Creations and son of Kalaipuli S.Thanu (the co-producer of VIP2) told The Hindu.
VIP 2, a sequel to the 2014 film Velaiilla Pattadhari, has also roped in AirAsia, ShopCJ, Airtel, PVR, True Value Firms and Ticketnew, in which Chinese e-commerce firm Alibaba has invested.
A spokesperson of Hike, in an email response, said, “We are creating a fun social experience for VIP 2 where people can share stickers, try filters and personify their favourite characters.” There are 36 stickers to choose from in Tamil, Telugu and Hindi. The sticker pack for VIP 2 and the filters will go live on August 11 to coincide with the release of the film. Earlier this year, Hike had forged a partnership for Bahubali.
Mr. Paranthaman said film-makers need to visit different places ahead of the release and experiment on all social media platforms.
