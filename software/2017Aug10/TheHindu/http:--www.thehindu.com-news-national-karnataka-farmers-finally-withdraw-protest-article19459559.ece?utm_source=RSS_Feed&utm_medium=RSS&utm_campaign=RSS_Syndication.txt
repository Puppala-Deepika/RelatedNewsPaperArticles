Members of Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha (KRRS) and Karnataka Janapara Vedike called off indefinite protests in the district on Wednesday following the State governmentâ€™s decision to discharge Cauvery water to canals.
While KRRS members were protesting near Sir M. Visvesvaraya Statue, the Vedike members were protesting at the Deshihalli lake near Maddur.
They welcomed the move of releasing water from the Krishnaraja Sagar (KRS) reservoir to various canals in the district. Shambhunahalli Surersh, district president, KRRS, hoped the decision will help the farmers to take up agricultural activities.
Meanwhile, the Vedike members staged a novel protest at the lake by burying their bodies upto the neck.
