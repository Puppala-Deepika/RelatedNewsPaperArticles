Legal clinic exclusively for differently-abled people launched
Free legal aid is no longer a distant dream for the differently-abled as the District Legal Services Authority (DLSA) and the Composite Regional Centre (CRC) for Persons with Disabilities have launched a legal clinic exclusively for them here.
K.N. Roshan Bijlee, Director, CRC, said that disabled people most often were at a loss when they were faced with denial of rights and benefits.
“There are many differently-abled people who are denied pension. Students are denied scholarships. The effort is to help them,” he said. Dr. Bijlee pointed out that people with disabilities were often entangled in property rights issues and dispute over roads. Free legal aid would be provided to them at the clinic to be held on the third Monday of every month on the Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences campus.
“Functionaries of the authority and advocates empanelled by them will conduct counselling sessions. They will also direct government departments to take action, if it is required, and approach the court too. The clinic will ensure that action is taken in all the cases,” Dr. Bijlee said. Such a facility is being offered for the first time in the State, he added.
District Judge M.R. Anitha opened the clinic on Wednesday.
