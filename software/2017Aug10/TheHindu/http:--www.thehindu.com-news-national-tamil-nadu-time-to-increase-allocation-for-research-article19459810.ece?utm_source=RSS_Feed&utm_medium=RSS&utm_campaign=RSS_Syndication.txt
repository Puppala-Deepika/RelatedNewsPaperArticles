Science enthusiasts take out march
A group of science enthusiasts took out a march on Elliot’s Beach on Wednesday demanding that the government allot at least 3% of the GDP for scientific and technological research. It also wanted the government to allocate 10% of the GDP for science education.
The rally was flagged off by Arvind Gupta, an educationist known for inventing low-cost scientific toys. Among the hundreds of participants were R. Ramanujam, a computer scientist from the Institute of Mathematical Science; V.S. Sundar, a retired mathematician from the institute and Hema Murthy and Suresh Govindaraj from the Indian Institute of Technology-Madras. Professors from Anna University also participated.
George Joseph, secretary of Breakthrough Science Society, read out the message from the International Science March, held in Caroline, U.S., earlier this year.
“We plan to conduct propaganda in different institutions and submit a memorandum to the Governor, who will then forward it to the Prime Minister,” Mr. Joseph said.
