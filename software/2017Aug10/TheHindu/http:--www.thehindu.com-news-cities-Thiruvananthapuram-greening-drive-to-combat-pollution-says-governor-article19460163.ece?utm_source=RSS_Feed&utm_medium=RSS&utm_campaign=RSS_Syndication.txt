Governor P. Sathasivam has noted that the greening drive was a fight against pollution, which was claiming millions of lives in the world.
He was addressing the students of the Lakshmibai National college of Physical Education after planting saplings along with them at the sprawling premises of the Raj Bhavan on Wednesday as part of the Swachchata Fortnight, being observed from August 1.
The Raj Bhavan’s policy, he said, was to plant ten saplings when one tree had to be cut for construction or other activities. The governor called upon the students to take the cleaning drive to the rural areas and to make cleanliness a way of life. He also expressed happiness over reports of Kerala topping the Swachh Bharat activities.
Minister for Tourism Kadakampally Surendran said that the government intends to start a ‘Freedom from Waste’ campaign soon. The Governor and the Minister planted a Red Sandal sapling while Olympian K. M. Beenamol planted Elanji. LNCPE Director G. Kishore, Davendra Kumar Dhodawat, secretary to the Governor, also planted saplings at the premises.
The programme was part of Sports Authority of India’s cleanliness drive in 11 LNCPE regions of Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry.
