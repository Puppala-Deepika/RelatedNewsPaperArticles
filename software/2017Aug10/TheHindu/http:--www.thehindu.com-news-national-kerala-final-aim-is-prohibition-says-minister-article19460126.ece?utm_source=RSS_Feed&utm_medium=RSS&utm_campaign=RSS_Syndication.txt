The ultimate aim of the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government is prohibition, Law Minister A.K. Balan told the Assembly here on Wednesday. Voluntary abstinence was but a way to prohibition.
He was speaking after introducing two Bills that take away from local bodies the power to sanction liquor shops. The Opposition pointed out that the government had, through an ordinance, withdrawn the authority of local bodies to relocate liquor shops along the roads. After a brief discussion, the Kerala Municipality Amendment Bill and the Kerala Panchayat Raj Amendment Bill were referred to the subject committee.
