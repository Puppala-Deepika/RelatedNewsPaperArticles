Court grants four weeks to the Central government to ensure that functional PUC centres are put up in National Capital Region.
In a bid to curb pollution, the Supreme Court on Thursday came out with a direction to insurance companies that they should not renew the insurance of a vehicle unless the owner provides a pollution under control (PUC) certificate.
A Bench headed by Justice Madan B Lokur also asked the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways to ensure that all fuel refilling centres in the National Capital Region (NCR) had PUC centres.
The court granted four weeks time to the Central government to ensure that functional PUC centres are put up in the NCR.
The court considered the suggestions given by the Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA).
The Bench was hearing a public interest litigation petition filed by environmentalist M.C. Mehta way back in 1985, dealing with various aspects of pollution.
