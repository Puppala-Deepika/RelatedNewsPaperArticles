Minister says giving tranquillizer shot to the elephants is not advisable
Forests Minister K. Raju has said efforts are on to send back to the forest the three wild elephants roaming in the Thiruvilwamala in Thrissur and the nearby Palakkad borders in the last three days, with the help of two Kumki elephants from Tamil Nadu.
Replying to questions in the Assembly on Wednesday, the Minister said, “Giving tranquillizer shot to the elephants is not advisable as they may resort to rampant violence in human settlements. We will wait for a day and take further steps.”
The Minister said the department had decided to train eight more Kumki elephants to avoid hiring them from Tamil Nadu. The number of Rapid Response Team (RRT) had been increased from six to 13 and was still inadequate to handle emergencies. More vehicles and equipment would be given to the RRT and additional RRTs would be formed.
