BJP district unit president K.S. Naveen has alleged that the State government has transferred the Deputy Commissioner and the Zilla Panchayat Chief Executive Officer of Chitradurga to hush up a ₹ 15-crore fodder scam in the district.
Speaking to reporters here on Wednesday, he said that honest officers in the Congress regime have had no freedom to work for the welfare of the common man and the farmers in every district. “The major reason for the transfer of officers was misappropriation of funds by the district in-charge Ministers and the Congress MLAs,” he alleged.
The officers concerned in all the taluks are not supplying good quality fodder to animals in the goshalas and instead of providing 5 kg fodder to animals, the authorities are providing only 2 kg fodder. The State government has failed in taking up drought relief works and also to ensure proper compensation to farmers who have incurred heavy losses owing to drought in the last four years, he said.
He alleged that the supporters of Hiriyur and Hosadurga MLAs are indulging in widespread illegal transportation of sand by misusing the police, revenue and other government departments. The benefits of different government schemes introduced by the Union government are not reaching the beneficiaries owing to the negligent attitude of the elected representatives, he alleged.
Though Union government is ready to start a Central school in Chitradurga, the authorities concerned here are not ready to provide the required 10 acres of land, he said.
Mr. Naveen said that Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and district in-charge Minister H. Anjaneya had promised to complete the Upper Bhadra project by the end of 2017 and ensure ample water to farmers in the district, but the project had not been completed in the stipulated time.
