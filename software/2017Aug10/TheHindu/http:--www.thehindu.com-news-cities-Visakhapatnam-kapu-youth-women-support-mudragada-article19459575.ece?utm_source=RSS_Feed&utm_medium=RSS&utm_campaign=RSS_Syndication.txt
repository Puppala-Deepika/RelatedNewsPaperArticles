Naidu will pay a heavy price: JAC
Kapu JAC leaders and members of the community from several villages, a majority of them youth and women, on Wednesday reached Kirlampudi to express their solidarity with former Minister Mudragada Padmanabham.
The Kapu leader has been making a vain attempt for the past several days to take out a padayatra to Amaravati to mount pressure on the government to include the caste in the list of BCs.
Fastening their hands and legs with long chains, they, along with Mr. Padmanabham, walked out of the residence of the Kapu leader up to the main gate, where the police stopped them.
Mr. Padmanabham asked the police to arrest and lodge them in jail instead of stopping them at the gate every day.
JAC leaders Akula Ramakrishna, Vasireddy Yesudas, Areti Prakash and Goutu Swami said the government was not allowing them to take out the padayatra and termed it as undemocratic.
“The Chief Minister has to pay a heavy price for this,” said Mr. Ramakrishna.
Later, the protesters beat steel plates with spoons as part of the daily protest programme.
