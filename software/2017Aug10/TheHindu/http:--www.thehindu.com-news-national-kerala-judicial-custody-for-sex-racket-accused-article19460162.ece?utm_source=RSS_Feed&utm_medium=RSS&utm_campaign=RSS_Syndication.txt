A magistrate court here on Wednesday remanded to 14 days in judicial custody the five persons, including two women, arrested on the suspicion of having run a commercial sex racket involving a minor Dalit girl.
The police identified the suspects as Sreekala, Shahida, Sadasivan, Vishnu, and Sumesh. They said more arrests were likely.
Investigators were in possession of the racketâ€™s client list, mostly mobile phone numbers.
The police will seek the custody of the accused for further interrogation and crime scene visits. The victim, who is seven months pregnant, is in protective custody. Investigators have sampled the DNA of the male suspects to identify parenthood.
