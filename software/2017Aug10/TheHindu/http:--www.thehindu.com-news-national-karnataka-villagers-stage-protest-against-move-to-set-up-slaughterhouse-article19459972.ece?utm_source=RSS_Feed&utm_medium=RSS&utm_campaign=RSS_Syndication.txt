Congress leader joins villagers in an agitation led by BJP MLA Sanjay Patil
Congress leader Lakshmi Hebbalkar joined villagers of Hire Bagewadi in a protest in Belagavi on Wednesday, against the State government’s decision to set up a hi-tech slaughterhouse in that village. BJP MLA Sanjay Patil led the protest.
The protesters walked to the Deputy Commissioner’s office and demanded that the government shift the project elsewhere. They held banners against the proposed project and shouted slogans against the government.
They submitted a resolution passed by the gram panchayat about why they don’t need the project.
They said that the site chosen was the Mallappa mountain whose grasslands would be lost if the slaughterhouse came up there.
Their other reasons included the existence of a Mallayya temple and fears that the slaughterhouse would emit a bad smell.
Kalavati Dharennanavar, gram panchayat president, Hasinabanu Madarangi vice-president and others have signed the memorandum. Ms. Hebbalkar requested Additional Deputy Commissioner Suresh Itnal to urge the government to shift the project away from the village.
It may be noted that Ms. Hebbalkar and Mr. Patil, who are believed to be political rivals, have come together for a people’s cause. Mr. Patil defeated her in the last Assembly elections. Earlier, the two have indulged in public spats. Also, their followers have quarrelled with one another in the past.
The State cabinet in its recent meeting had cleared two slaughterhouses, one in Bengaluru Rural and the other in Hire Bagewadi in Belagavi district.
