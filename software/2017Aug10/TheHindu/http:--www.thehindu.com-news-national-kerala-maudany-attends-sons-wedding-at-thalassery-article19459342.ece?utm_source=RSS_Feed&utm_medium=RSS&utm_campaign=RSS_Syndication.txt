Leaders of various parties attend ceremony
People’s Democratic Party (PDP) chairman Abdul Nasir Maudany attended the wedding of his son at Thalassery here on Wednesday, as leaders of various organisations, including the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the Congress, turned up to meet him and wish the bridegroom.
Mr. Maudany, charged in the 2008 Bengaluru serial bomb blast cases and arrested subsequently, had been granted bail to attend to his ailing mother. He reached Thalassery on the Thiruvananthapuram-Mangaluru Express in the morning. He was greeted with chanting by a large number of his party workers. At noon, he attended the function to solemnise the marriage of his son Hafis Umar Mukthar at Thalassery Town Hall.
SC intervention
In his brief address before the ceremony, Mr. Maudany said he was the first parent to attend his son’s wedding by paying Goods and Services Tax.
He was referring to the payment of ₹1.56 lakh to the Bengaluru police for providing him police escort. He said he could attend the marriage because of the strong intervention of the Supreme Court. He thanked all democratically minded people and leaders of the government and the Opposition for helping him attend the ceremony.
CPI(M) central committee member E.P. Jayarajan, party district unit secretary P. Jayarajan, Congress leader K. Sudhakaran, district Congress president Satheeshan Pacheni, Jamaat-e-Islami leader Sheikh Muhammad Karakkunnu, PDP leader Poonthura Siraj, and leaders of various organisations were among those who attended the wedding. Samastha Kerala Jamiyathul Ulema State president Jafri Thangal solemnised the marriage.
