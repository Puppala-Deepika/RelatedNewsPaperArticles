Modi again tells BJP MPs to ensure their presence in parliament

Narendra Modi on Thursday again tried to drill among BJP MPs a sense of responsibility towards their parliamentary duties and wondered why the party has to issue a whip to ensure their presence in both the Houses.
The PM said this at the BJP parliamentary meeting held on Thursday morning where he also felicitated BJP president Amit Shah for successfully completing three years in office and becoming a Rajya Sabha member. Other senior leaders such as LK Advani and Arun Jaitley were also present at meeting which is the the last in the ongoing monsoon session that ends on Friday.
Modi's reiteration comes days after he had asked BJP chief Amit Shah to pull up ministers and party MPs for skipping a Rajya Sabha session in which the opposition capitalising on poor strength at treasury benches had managed to embarass the government by getting an amendment passed in the politically important OBC bill. The legislation sought to prove constitutional status to the National Commission for Backward Classes.
Shah is said to have briefed the lawmakers on the outcome of the Rajya Sabha elections from Gujarat where he along with union minister Smirit Irani won but lost the third seat to Congress leader Ahmed Patel by one vote despite putting all might in a battle of prestige.
