‘To get one MP into the RS, the party lost 15 MLAs’
A day after the Rajya Sabha poll in Gujarat where the BJP was bested by senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel in a photo finish, the party has claimed that the losses on the other side were greater despite the electoral victory.
“Our party fought the polls with full vigour and we put up a great fight,” BJP general secretary Bhupendra Yadav, in charge of Gujarat, told The Hindu. “Two of our party leaders [BJP president Amit Shah and Union Minister Smriti Irani] got elected yesterday, while the Congress, in order to get one MP into the Rajya Sabha has lost 15 of its MLAs to disqualification and rebellion. The Congress had to work hard to secure this victory,” he said.
While the BJP has been projecting that the Congress had secured a Pyrrhic victory, there were some murmurs about the ratcheting up of the contest for one Rajya Sabha seat. “The spectacle of several Union Ministers rushing to the EC could have been avoided,” said a senior MP of the party.
Game plan messed up
The BJP was also counting the costs of the contest and was, a day later, still doing the math. “The disqualification of the two rebel Congress MLAs disturbed the quota required and messed up the game plan. It brought down the quota to 43.5, which our candidate couldn’t secure,” said a source.
Even then, the party said, the three BJP candidates put together secured 132 votes, of which 122 were its own MLAs, five were the early Congress rebels including Shankarsinh Vaghela (two had been disqualified by EC), one cross-vote from the Congress while the polling was on, one NCP vote and one from the lone JD(U) MLA Chotubhai Vasava. When told that the Congress too was claiming Mr. Vasava’s vote, the leader said they were sure of their count.
