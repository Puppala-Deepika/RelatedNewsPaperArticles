Congress stalwart Ahmed Patel, who retained his Rajya Sabha seat in Gujarat in a humdinger of a contest, on Wednesday said his victory has come as a boost to the party workers and set an aim of 125 seats in the Assembly polls due later this year.
“This was the toughest election that I have fought in my life. I thank my party leaders and my MLAs,” Mr. Patel, political secretary to party president Sonia Gandhi said.
