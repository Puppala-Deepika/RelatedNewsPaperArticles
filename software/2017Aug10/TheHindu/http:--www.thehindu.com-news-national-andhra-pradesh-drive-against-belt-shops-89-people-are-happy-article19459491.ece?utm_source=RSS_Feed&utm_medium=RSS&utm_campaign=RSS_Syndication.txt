Complaints being monitored at highest level: Kutumba Rao
The Excise Department’s crackdown on belt shops has won the appreciation of the people in all but six districts. The level of satisfaction has improved by 7 % to 89 % from the last week’s 82 % compared to just 41.6 % before the Cabinet decision.
Revealing the findings of the latest survey done by the Mega Call Centre on Wednesday, Andhra Pradesh (A.P.) State Planning Board Vice-Chairman C. Kutumba Rao said demands for shifting of liquor shops from residential areas continue to pour in as the public, particularly women, were feeling troubled, and that the complaints were being redirected to the Excise Department through a mobile application and monitored at the highest level. The focus was to be laid on Anantapur, Guntur, Kadapa, Kurnool, Srikakulam and East Godavari districts. Of the 2,21,676 people contacted, 1,05,609 responded.
Thumbs up for SIT probe
On steps taken to expose the culprits behind the land scandal in Visakhapatnam, 90 % of the respondents approved of the constitution of SIT and the overall positive response stood at 75%. The survey was done in the Anakapalle, Bheemili, Gajuwaka, Pendurthy and Visakhapatnam East constituencies.
The Anna Amrutha Hastham scheme of serving nutritious food at Anganwadi centres too was appreciated by 83 % of the respondents.
