Highway blockades were witnessed in different parts of the district on Wednesday as part of an agitation by farmers demanding the complete waiver of farm loans extended by all financial institutions, among other demands.

Vehicles were lined up on both sides of the road in view of the blockade. The police had to take protesters into custody in different places to bring the situation back to normal.
The protest was part of the nationwide call for blocking highways given by Rashtriya Kisan Mahasangha with the support of more than 153 farmers’ organisations.
Other demands
According to a statement by Federation of Karnataka State Farmers’ Associations and State Sugarcane Growers’ Association, the farmers are not only demanding a complete waiver of farm loans, but also the implementation of Dr. M.S. Swaminathan Committee Report on the fixation of scientific support for agricultural produce.
Karnataka State Sugarcane Growers’ Association president Kurubur Shanthakumar found fault with the government over its failure to compensate farmers for crop loss suffered on account of successive droughts. In view of the failure of rain this year also, the government should declare drought compensation to farmers and provide interest-free loan schemes.
He also urged the government to release water from the reservoirs and fill up the lakes to facilitate the farmers to grow crops.
