The government will bring out a comprehensive cinema policy covering all sections of the industry, Minister for Culture and Cinema A.K. Balan has said.
Replying to a submission of M. Swaraj on the need for having a cinema policy in the Assembly on Wednesday, Mr. Balan said the government was considering a report submitted by filmmaker Adoor Gopalakrishnan and has now engaged an expert committee comprising jurist Hema, actor Sarada, and former IAS officer K.B. Valsala Kumari to probe into the issues cited in a memorandum submitted by the Women in Cinema Collective (WCC) to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan recently.
