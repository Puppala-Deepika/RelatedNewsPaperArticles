‘No unusual movement, deployment’
The Army has made no unusual movement or additional deployment in the Doklam area since the standoff began with China, official sources said on Wednesday. The comments come as diplomatic efforts continue to find a mutually acceptable solution to the face-off.
“Any movement there is a regular one for support and maintenance of the two brigades which are pre-deployed. There is nothing unusual. It is the same status of no war, no peace,” a source said.
Three brigades
There are two brigades from different divisions deployed in the area and there is one more brigade slightly behind.
At the standoff site, the status quo continues with 400 soldiers from each side sitting at the site with tents pitched in.
China has maintained an aggressive diplomatic posture since the standoff began on June 16, claiming that Indian troops were on Chinese territory.
Indian troops physically prevented Chinese troops from building a road through the disputed Doklam plateau which triggered an extended standoff. However, sources said that even on the Chinese side, no unusual movement had been noticed. In the past few days, Chinese media has upped the ante and warned that India should learn a lesson, or the Chinese Army may carry out limited action to evict Indian troops.
