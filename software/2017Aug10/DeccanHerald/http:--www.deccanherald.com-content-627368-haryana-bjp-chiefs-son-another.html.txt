The two accused the high profile Varnika stalking case, Vikas Barala, the son of Haryana BJP chief, and his accomplice Aashish, have denied charges of attempted abduction against them during interrogation by the police since yesterday, it is learnt. The accused were remanded to two days in police custody after they were produced before the Court on Thursday.
They have denied the attempted abduction charge entirely but have admitted to be have been on the route that was taken by Varnika that night, sources said, adding that Vikas told the police that he had gone out that evening with his friend to replace shoes from a Mall. He admitted to have had a bottle of beer that night. The case is now headed for a long drawn legal battle. Vikas and the other accused managed to get to prepare their defence in case since they were out roaming freely in the last few days after the police bailed them out initially. The police said, the two day remand period will be utilized to corroborate the evidence and statement given by the accused.
The Chandigarh police on Wednesday had re-arrested Vikas Barala and his accomplice after they were charged with attempted abduction in the case. They have been charges with fresh IPC sections of the IPC (365 and 511) which attract a maximum punishment of 7-years. The investigation has been shrouded in suspicion, at least until the accused were arrested on Wednesday.
